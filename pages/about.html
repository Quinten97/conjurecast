              <p class="player-description">
                Quinten Favorite has been at the helm of the group since 2011,
                known for his charming and mild-mannered nature. As the eternal
                Dungeon Master, Quinten thrives on crafting story-rich campaigns
                with light tones that create memorable experiences for his
                friends and family. In addition to his DM role, he acts as the
                media editor for the podcast, embracing the "jack of all trades,
                master of none" approach. Fun fact: Quinten is a lightweight
                when it comes to alcohol and can often be found getting tipsy
                after just a couple of hard apple ciders.

                Alexander Younts has been a cherished member of the group since
                2016, bringing a warm and goofy energy that lights up every
                session. An IT professional by day and a dedicated roleplayer by
                night, Alex is known for crafting unique characters with
                intricate backstories and memorable quirks. His passion for
                roleplaying shines through as he effortlessly steps into any
                role, adding depth and unpredictability to the campaign. Though
                his contributions are centered on playing, his creativity and
                humor are indispensable to the podcast. Alex is also full of
                surprises—he proudly sports a third nipple, which, like his
                characters, is one of a kind.

                playing a key role in Horizons Edge. Known for his intelligence

                characters with dynamic personalities and distinct voices that
                bring depth to the story. Beyond the table, Cory is the walking
                embodiment of a light encyclopedia, always serving as a fount of
                knowledge for the group. His thoughtful approach to both
                gameplay and storytelling ensures that every session is as
                engaging as it is memorable.

                Hannah Favorite has been captivating audiences and fellow
                players alike since joining the group in 2018. Confident and
                mysterious, she brings a unique energy to the table,
                consistently creating characters that challenge her as a player
                and elevate every campaign she’s part of. In addition to her
                role as a player, Hannah handles most of the graphic design work
                for the podcast, adding a touch of artistry both in-game and
                behind the scenes. Fun fact: Hannah has piebaldism, which adds a
                striking and beautiful dimension to her complexion and hair,
                making her as unforgettable as the characters she plays.

                joined the group in 2022, but he quickly became an integral part
                of the team. Considerate and dashing, Nash approaches every
